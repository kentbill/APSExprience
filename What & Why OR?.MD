#What & Why Operation Research

In this article, I'll present what is the Opertaion Research and why we should use it to solve some optimization problems.

Some problems in the world, you could not find a algorithm that has the deterministic polynomial time to solve. It means, you can NOT find a method or algorithm to solve it easy. e.g. in equipment the planning va

for these problems, the time spent are exponential growth while the problem size grow. e.g. TSP, VRP problems.
